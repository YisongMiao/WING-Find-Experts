{"title": "Modular Federated Learning: A Meta-Framework Perspective", "abstract": "Background: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative machine learning across decentralised data sources while preserving data privacy, representing a paradigm shift for sensitive and distributed environments. Despite rapid advancements, FL remains a complex and multifaceted field, requiring a structured understanding of its methodologies, systems, and application domains. Objectives: This survey introduces a meta-framework perspective that conceptualises FL as a composition of modular components, each addressing core dimensions such as communication, optimisation, security, and privacy. This structured lens is intended to ease comprehension and promote a more systematic analysis of the field. Scope and Contributions: We begin with a historical contextualisation, tracing FLâ€™s evolution from distributed optimisation to modern decentralised learning paradigms. We then formalise a modular meta-framework that organises existing FL approaches into interoperable components. As part of this, we propose a novel taxonomy that distinguishes Aggregation from Alignment, introducing Alignment as a fundamental operator complementing traditional aggregation processes. We further contrast FL with related paradigms in distributed machine learning to delineate its unique characteristics and boundaries. Practical Relevance: To bridge theoretical foundations with practical implementations, we survey open-source Python FL frameworks, highlighting their architectural choices, capabilities, and limitations in real-world scenarios. Conclusions: We synthesise persistent challenges across FL subfields, spanning system-level constraints, optimisation bottlenecks, environmental impact, and deployment complexity. Finally, we outline key open research directions, aiming to guide future developments in FL across both academia and industry. By framing FL through a modular meta-framework and emphasising the roles of Aggregation and Alignment, this survey provides a solid foundation for understanding and advancing FL."}
