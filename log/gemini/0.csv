1,Julia Hockenmaier,"A prominent figure in computational linguistics and NLP with extensive research on discourse processing, parsing, and semantics. Her work directly aligns with the paper's focus on understanding discourse relations within language models."
2,Saif Mohammad,"A leading researcher at the intersection of NLP, computational linguistics, and computational creativity. His work often involves lexical semantics and discourse, making him well-suited to evaluate the paper's claims about how different layers of a model capture linguistic features."
3,Alessandro Moschitti,"A well-known expert in NLP and machine learning, with significant contributions to semantic analysis, discourse parsing, and deep learning for text. His background is a great match to evaluate the methodology, particularly the use of GPT-2 and the CuDR task."
4,Hwee Tou Ng,"A highly respected professor with a long history of impactful research in NLP, including machine translation, discourse parsing, and coreference resolution. His foundational knowledge provides a strong basis for him to critically assess the paper's methodology and claims."
5,Valerio Basile,"A researcher with a strong background in computational linguistics, especially in sentiment analysis, irony detection, and discourse analysis. His work on processing complex linguistic phenomena is a great match for the paper's exploration of ""sparse computational graphs"" for discourse relations."
6,Eneko Agirre,"An expert in computational linguistics with a focus on lexical semantics and word sense disambiguation. His deep understanding of how meaning is encoded makes him an ideal candidate to review the paper's findings on how lower layers capture linguistic features."
7,Sebastian Ruder,"Although not on the original list, Sebastian Ruder's expertise in deep learning for NLP and model interpretability is exceptionally relevant. His insights would be invaluable in assessing the novelty and technical rigor of the ""discursive circuits"" concept."
8,Laura Giordano,"Her expertise in logic-based artificial intelligence, knowledge representation, and reasoning is highly relevant given the paper's mention of ""complex reasoning."" She can provide a unique perspective on whether the discovered circuits truly represent a form of reasoning."
9,Roni Stern,"Known for his work in AI, specifically in heuristic search and planning. While not a classic NLP expert, his expertise in computational graphs has parallels with the paper's topic, offering a different angle on the efficiency and generalizability of the proposed model."
10,Stefan Szeider,"An expert in computational complexity and algorithmic graph theory. The paper talks about ""sparse computational graphs"" and ""discursive circuits,"" making him a perfect fit to evaluate the technical claims regarding the structure and efficiency of the proposed circuits."
