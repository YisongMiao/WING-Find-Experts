1,"Virginia Dignum","A world-renowned expert in Responsible AI and AI ethics, which are central themes of the paper. Her work specifically focuses on the societal, ethical, and legal aspects of AI, making her an exceptional choice to evaluate the paper's claims about regulatory compliance and consumer trust."
2,"Nisarg Shah","His research sits at the intersection of computer science and economics, with a strong focus on algorithmic fairness and social choice theory. The paper explicitly mentions concerns about fairness, and Dr. Shah's expertise provides a solid theoretical foundation to evaluate how XAI can mitigate bias and ensure equitable outcomes."
3,"Ferdinando Fioretto","He is a rising star in the field of Responsible AI, with research interests that include algorithmic fairness and differential privacy. His work on integrating these concepts into machine learning and optimization is directly relevant to the paper's focus on transparency and fairness in AI models."
4,"Sriraam Natarajan","He has a strong track record in explainable AI and human-AI interaction. He has published a synthesis lecture on ""Explainable Human-AI Interaction,"" which directly aligns with the paper's call for stakeholder-centric explainability, and his work is critical for building trust."
5,"Maria Perez-Ortiz","Her research on interpretability in machine learning makes her a highly relevant candidate. As a researcher focused on applied AI, she understands how to bridge the gap between theoretical concepts and real-world deployment. Her expertise allows her to critically assess the paper's claims about XAI adoption and the effectiveness of various techniques."
6,"Ofra Amir","Her main research interest is at the nexus of AI and human-computer interaction. Her work focuses on creating intelligent systems that support people, making her an ideal fit for the paper's emphasis on ""stakeholder-centric explainability approaches"" and pushing the authors to consider the human element of explainability."
7,"Sanmay Das","As a professor with a focus on AI for social impact, he brings a unique blend of technical and practical expertise. His background includes working with the U.S. Treasury department on machine learning for credit risk analysis, which is directly analogous to the insurance domain. He can assess the paper's claims from a business and social-good perspective."
8,"Toby Walsh","He is a well-known and respected figure in the broader AI community. His ability to connect the technical details of AI with its real-world impact makes him a great choice. He can evaluate the paper's ""Roadmap"" and its strategic recommendations to ensure the paper addresses the big-picture challenges of trust and transparency."
9,"Siddharth Srivastava","His work on automated planning, knowledge representation, and robustness is highly relevant. The paper mentions the need for XAI to ""enhance model robustness,"" and his research on developing reliable and trustworthy autonomous systems is a strong match for this requirement."
10,"Kuldeep Meel","His research is at the intersection of formal methods and AI, focusing on the development of robust, reliable, and trustworthy systems. His work provides a solid foundation for evaluating the formal aspects of AI models, which is particularly relevant for the paper's discussion of bias detection and model performance."
