1,Julia Hockenmaier,"Expert in computational linguistics, discourse, and semantics (CCG grammars, syntax–semantics interface); strong match for linguistic framing of discursive circuits."
2,Eneko Agirre,"Specialist in discourse, semantic similarity, and lexical semantics; extensive work on discourse parsing and coherence modeling; directly aligned with CuDR/PDTB evaluation."
3,Fei Liu,"Well-known for work on discourse relations, summarization, and coherence; strong empirical grounding in datasets and evaluation tasks tied to discourse understanding."
4,Saif Mohammad,"Research on semantics, discourse-level meaning, figurative language, stance, and interpretability; experienced AE; ensures high editorial standards."
5,Kai-Wei Chang,"Active in representation learning, bias/fairness, and large-scale NLP models; strengthens technical rigor for interpretability and circuit discovery framing."
6,Desmond Elliott,"Expert in language–vision models and discourse-level multimodality; bridges representation learning and semantics; supports cross-framework generalization (PDTB ↔ RST ↔ SDRT)."
7,Xuanjing Huang,"Senior NLP scholar with contributions in language modeling, discourse, and semantics; brings multilingual and evaluation breadth to the work."
8,Hwee Tou Ng,"Leader in NLP, machine translation, and discourse parsing; expertise in coherence and linguistic structure complements circuit-level analysis."
9,Bo Li,"Recognized for trustworthy and robust machine learning, including federated and secure models; strengthens robustness and interpretability aspects of the work."
10,Valerio Basile,"Active in computational semantics, discourse analysis, and evaluation frameworks; experience with semantic representation and task-specific datasets aligned with CuDR."
