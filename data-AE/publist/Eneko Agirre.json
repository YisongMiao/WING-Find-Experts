      "title": "Adding simple structure at inference improves Vision-Language Compositionality",
      "abstract": "Dual encoder Vision-Language Models (VLM) such as CLIP are widely used for image-text retrieval tasks. However, those models struggle with compositionality, showing a bag-of-words-like behavior that limits their retrieval performance. Many different training approaches have been proposed to improve the vision-language compositionality capabilities of those models. In comparison, inference-time techniques have received little attention. In this paper, we propose to add simple structure at inference, where, given an image and a caption: i) we divide the image into different smaller crops, ii) we extract text segments, capturing objects, attributes and relations, iii) using a VLM, we find the image crops that better align with text segments obtaining matches, and iv) we compute the final image-text similarity aggregating the individual similarities of the matches. Based on various popular dual encoder VLMs, we evaluate our approach in controlled and natural datasets for VL compositionality. We find that our approach consistently improves the performance of evaluated VLMs without any training, which shows the potential of inference-time techniques. The results are especially good for attribute-object binding as shown in the controlled dataset. As a result of an extensive analysis: i) we show that processing image crops is actually essential for the observed gains in performance, and ii) we identify specific areas to further improve inference-time approaches. △ Less",

      "title": "Instructing Large Language Models for Low-Resource Languages: A Systematic Study for Basque",
      "abstract": "Instructing language models with user intent requires large instruction datasets, which are only available for a limited set of languages. In this paper, we explore alternatives to conventional instruction adaptation pipelines in low-resource scenarios. We assume a realistic scenario for low-resource languages, where only the following are available: corpora in the target language, existing open-weight multilingual base and instructed backbone LLMs, and synthetically generated instructions sampled from the instructed backbone. We present a comprehensive set of experiments for Basque that systematically study different combinations of these components evaluated on benchmarks and human preferences from 1,680 participants. Our conclusions show that target language corpora are essential, with synthetic instructions yielding robust models, and, most importantly, that using as backbone an instruction-tuned model outperforms using a base non-instructed model, and improved results when scaling up. Using Llama 3.1 instruct 70B as backbone our model comes near frontier models of much larger sizes for Basque, without using any Basque data apart from the 1.2B word corpora. We release code, models, instruction datasets, and human preferences to support full reproducibility in future research on low-resource language adaptation. △ Less",

      "abstract": "Information Extraction (IE) systems are traditionally domain-specific, requiring costly adaptation that involves expert schema design, data annotation, and model training. While Large Language Models have shown promise in zero-shot IE, performance degrades significantly in unseen domains where label definitions differ. This paper introduces GUIDEX, a novel method that automatically defines domain-specific schemas, infers guidelines, and generates synthetically labeled instances, allowing for better out-of-domain generalization. Fine-tuning Llama 3.1 with GUIDEX sets a new state-of-the-art across seven zeroshot Named Entity Recognition benchmarks. Models trained with GUIDEX gain up to 7 F1 points over previous methods without humanlabeled data, and nearly 2 F1 points higher when combined with it. Models trained on GUIDEX demonstrate enhanced comprehension of complex, domain-specific annotation schemas.

      "title": "Emergent Abilities of Large Language Models under Continued Pretraining for Language Adaptation",
      "abstract": "Continued pretraining (CPT) is a popular approach to adapt existing large language models (LLMs) to new languages. When doing so, it is common practice to include a portion of English data in the mixture, but its role has not been carefully studied to date. In this work, we show that including English does not impact validation perplexity, yet it is critical for the emergence of downstream capabilities in the target language. We introduce a language-agnostic benchmark for in-context learning (ICL), which reveals catastrophic forgetting early on CPT when English is not included. This in turn damages the ability of the model to generalize to downstream prompts in the target language as measured by perplexity, even if it does not manifest in terms of accuracy until later in training, and can be tied to a big shift in the model parameters. Based on these insights, we introduce curriculum learning and exponential moving average (EMA) of weights as effective alternatives to mitigate the need for English. All in all, our work sheds light into the dynamics by which emergent abilities arise when doing CPT for language adaptation, and can serve as a foundation to design more effective methods in the future. △ Less",

We show that WiCkeD can be automatically applied to any existing benchmark, making it more challenging. We apply WiCkeD to 6 popular benchmarks and use it to evaluate 18 open-weight LLMs. The performance of the models drops 12.1 points on average with respect to the original versions of the datasets. When using chain-of-thought on 3 MMLU datasets, the performance drop for the WiCkeD variant is similar to the one observed when using the LLMs directly, showing that WiCkeD is also challenging for models with enhanced reasoning abilities. WiCkeD also uncovers that some models are more sensitive to the extra reasoning required, providing additional information with respect to the original benchmarks.

The workshop fostered a shared task to collect evidence on data contamination in current available datasets and models. The goal of the shared task and associated database is to assist the community in understanding the extent of the problem and to assist researchers in avoiding reporting evaluation results on known contaminated resources. The shared task provides a structured, centralized public database for the collection of contamination evidence, open to contributions from the community via GitHub pool requests.

      "abstract": "Existing Vision-Language Compositionality (VLC) benchmarks like SugarCrepe are formulated as image-to-text retrieval problems, where, given an image, the models need to select between the correct textual description and a synthetic hard negative text. In this work, we present the Bidirectional Vision-Language Compositionality (BiVLC) dataset. The novelty of BiVLC is to add a synthetic hard negative image generated from the synthetic text, resulting in two image-to-text retrieval examples (one for each image) and, more importantly, two text-to-image retrieval examples (one for each text). Human annotators filter out ill-formed examples ensuring the validity of the benchmark. The experiments on BiVLC uncover a weakness of current multimodal models, as they perform poorly in the text-to-image direction. In fact, when considering both retrieval directions, the conclusions obtained in previous works change significantly. In addition to the benchmark, we show that a contrastive model trained using synthetic images and texts significantly improves over the base model in SugarCrepe and in BiVLC for both retrieval directions. The gap to human performance in BiVLC confirms that Vision-Language Compositionality is still a challenging problem.

      "abstract": "Cross-lingual transfer-learning is widely used in Event Extraction for low-resource languages and involves a Multilingual Language Model that is trained in a source language and applied to the target language. This paper studies whether the typological similarity between source and target languages impacts the performance of cross-lingual transfer, an under-explored topic. We first focus on Basque as the target language, which is an ideal target language because it is typologically different from surrounding languages. Our experiments on three Event Extraction tasks show that the shared linguistic characteristic between source and target languages does have an impact on transfer quality. Further analysis of 72 language pairs reveals that for tasks that involve token classification such as entity and event trigger identification, common writing script and morphological features produce higher quality cross-lingual transfer. In contrast, for tasks involving structural prediction like argument extraction, common word order is the most relevant feature. In addition, we show that when increasing the training size, not all the languages scale in the same way in the cross-lingual setting. To perform the experiments we introduce EusIE, an event extraction dataset for Basque, which follows the Multilingual Event Extraction dataset (MEE).

In addition, it is competitive with GPT-4 Turbo in language proficiency and understanding, despite lagging behind in reading comprehension and knowledge-intensive tasks. Both the Latxa family of models, as well as our new pretraining corpora and evaluation datasets, are publicly available under open licenses.

      "title": "Grounding Spatial Relations in Text-Only Language Models",
      "abstract": "This paper shows that text-only Language Models (LM) can learn to ground spatial relations like \"left of\" or \"below\" if they are provided with explicit location information of objects and they are properly trained to leverage those locations. We perform experiments on a verbalized version of the Visual Spatial Reasoning (VSR) dataset, where images are coupled with textual statements which contain real or fake spatial relations between two objects of the image. We verbalize the images using an off-the-shelf object detector, adding location tokens to every object label to represent their bounding boxes in textual form. Given the small size of VSR, we do not observe any improvement when using locations, but pretraining the LM over a synthetic dataset automatically derived by us improves results significantly when using location tokens. We thus show that locations allow LMs to ground spatial relations, with our text-only LMs outperforming Vision-and-Language Models and setting the new state-of-the-art for the VSR dataset. Our analysis show that our text-only LMs can generalize beyond the relations seen in the synthetic dataset to some extent, learning also more useful information than that encoded in the spatial rules we used to create the synthetic dataset itself. △ Less",

      "abstract": "Existing work has observed that current text-to-image systems do not accurately reflect explicit spatial relations between objects such as 'left of' or 'below'. We hypothesize that this is because explicit spatial relations rarely appear in the image captions used to train these models. We propose an automatic method that, given existing images, generates synthetic captions that contain 14 explicit spatial relations. We introduce the Spatial Relation for Generation (SR4G) dataset, which contains 9.9 millions image-caption pairs for training, and more than 60 thousand captions for evaluation. In order to test generalization we also provide an 'unseen' split, where the set of objects in the train and test captions are disjoint. SR4G is the first dataset that can be used to spatially fine-tune text-to-image systems. We show that fine-tuning two different Stable Diffusion models (denoted as SD$_{SR4G}$) yields up to 9 points improvements in the VISOR metric. The improvement holds in the 'unseen' split, showing that SD$_{SR4G}$ is able to generalize to unseen objects. SD$_{SR4G}$ improves the state-of-the-art with fewer parameters, and avoids complex architectures. Our analysis shows that improvement is consistent for all relations.

      "abstract": "Table-to-text generation involves generating appropriate textual descriptions given structured tabular data. It has attracted increasing attention in recent years thanks to the popularity of neural network models and the availability of large-scale datasets. A common feature across existing methods is their treatment of the input as a string, i.e., by employing linearization techniques that do not always preserve information in the table, are verbose, and lack space efficiency. We propose to rethink data-to-text generation as a visual recognition task, removing the need for rendering the input in a string format. We present PixT3, a multimodal table-to-text model that overcomes the challenges of linearization and input size limitations encountered by existing models. PixT3 is trained with a new self-supervised learning objective to reinforce table structure awareness and is applicable to open-ended and controlled generation settings. Experiments on the ToTTo and Logic2Text benchmarks show that PixT3 is competitive and, in some settings, superior to generators that operate solely on text. △ Less",

      "title": "NLP Evaluation in trouble: On the Need to Measure LLM Data Contamination for each Benchmark",
      "abstract": "In this position paper, we argue that the classical evaluation on Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks using annotated benchmarks is in trouble. The worst kind of data contamination happens when a Large Language Model (LLM) is trained on the test split of a benchmark, and then evaluated in the same benchmark. The extent of the problem is unknown, as it is not straightforward to measure. Contamination causes an overestimation of the performance of a contaminated model in a target benchmark and associated task with respect to their non-contaminated counterparts. The consequences can be very harmful, with wrong scientific conclusions being published while other correct ones are discarded. This position paper defines different levels of data contamination and argues for a community effort, including the development of automatic and semi-automatic measures to detect when data from a benchmark was exposed to a model, and suggestions for flagging papers with conclusions that are compromised by data contamination. △ Less",

While end-to-end techniques suffer from low factual correctness (fidelity), a previous study reported gains when using manual logical forms (LF) that represent the selected content and the semantics of the target text. Given the manual step, it was not clear whether automatic LFs would be effective, or whether the improvement came from content selection alone. We present TlT which, given a table and a selection of the content, first produces LFs and then the textual statement. We show for the first time that automatic LFs improve quality, with an increase in fidelity of 30 points over a comparable system not using LFs. Our experiments allow to quantify the remaining challenges for high factual correctness, with automatic selection of content coming first, followed by better Logic-to-Text generation and, to a lesser extent, better Table-to-Logic parsing. △ Less",

Synthetic annotation by query generation using Large Language Models or rule-based string manipulation has been proposed as an alternative, but their relative merits have not been analysed. In this paper, we compare both methods head-to-head using the same neural IR architecture. We focus on the BEIR benchmark, which includes test datasets from several domains with no training data, and explore two scenarios: zero-shot, where the supervised system is trained in a large out-of-domain dataset (MS-MARCO); and unsupervised domain adaptation, where, in addition to MS-MARCO, the system is fine-tuned in synthetic data from the target domain. Our results indicate that Large Language Models outperform rule-based methods in all scenarios by a large margin, and, more importantly, that unsupervised domain adaptation is effective compared to applying a supervised IR system in a zero-shot fashion. In addition we explore several sizes of open Large Language Models to generate synthetic data and find that a medium-sized model suffices.

However, they have been less successful in Information Extraction (IE), lagging behind task-specific models. Typically, IE tasks are characterized by complex annotation guidelines that describe the task and give examples to humans. Previous attempts to leverage such information have failed, even with the largest models, as they are not able to follow the guidelines out of the box. In this paper, we propose GoLLIE (Guideline-following Large Language Model for IE), a model able to improve zero-shot results on unseen IE tasks by virtue of being fine-tuned to comply with annotation guidelines. Comprehensive evaluation empirically demonstrates that GoLLIE is able to generalize to and follow unseen guidelines, outperforming previous attempts at zero-shot information extraction.

However, this is incompatible with a recent trend in the field, where the highest quality models are only available as black-boxes through inference APIs. Even when the model weights are available, the computational cost of fine-tuning large LMs can be prohibitive for most practitioners. In this work, we present a lightweight method for adapting large LMs to new domains and tasks, assuming no access to their weights or intermediate activations. Our approach fine-tunes a small white-box LM and combines it with the large black-box LM at the probability level through a small network, learned on a small validation set. We validate our approach by adapting a large LM (OPT-30B) to several domains and a downstream task (machine translation), observing improved performance in all cases, of up to 9%, while using a domain expert 23x smaller. △ Less",

We performed this analysis by prompting commonly used Languages Models such as BERT or RoBERTa to perform the task of Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD).

These models were developed either within large projects using very large private corpora or by means of smaller scale academic efforts leveraging freely available data. In this paper we present a comprehensive head-to-head comparison of language models for Spanish with the following results: (i) Previously ignored multilingual models from large companies fare better than monolingual models, substantially changing the evaluation landscape of language models in Spanish; (ii) Results across the monolingual models are not conclusive, with supposedly smaller and inferior models performing competitively. Based on these empirical results, we argue for the need of more research to understand the factors underlying them. In this sense, the effect of corpus size, quality and pre-training techniques need to be further investigated to be able to obtain Spanish monolingual models significantly better than the multilingual ones released by large private companies, specially in the face of rapid ongoing progress in the field. The recent activity in the development of language technology for Spanish is to be welcomed, but our results show that building language models remains an open, resource-heavy problem which requires to marry resources (monetary and/or computational) with the best research expertise and practice. △ Less",

In this paper, we formalize the implicit similarity function induced by this approach, and show that it is susceptible to non-paraphrase pairs sharing a single ambiguous translation. Based on these insights, we design an alternative similarity metric that mitigates this issue by requiring the entire translation distribution to match, and implement a relaxation of it through the Information Bottleneck method. Our approach incorporates an adversarial term into MT training in order to learn representations that encode as much information about the reference translation as possible, while keeping as little information about the input as possible. Paraphrases can be generated by decoding back to the source from this representation, without having to generate pivot translations. In addition to being more principled and efficient than round-trip MT, our approach offers an adjustable parameter to control the fidelity-diversity trade-off, and obtains better results in our experiments. △ Less",

The fact that relations in current RE datasets are easily verbalized casts doubts on whether entailment would be effective in more complex tasks. In this work we show that entailment is also effective in Event Argument Extraction (EAE), reducing the need of manual annotation to 50% and 20% in ACE and WikiEvents respectively, while achieving the same performance as with full training. More importantly, we show that recasting EAE as entailment alleviates the dependency on schemas, which has been a road-block for transferring annotations between domains. Thanks to the entailment, the multi-source transfer between ACE and WikiEvents further reduces annotation down to 10% and 5% (respectively) of the full training without transfer. Our analysis shows that the key to good results is the use of several entailment datasets to pre-train the entailment model. Similar to previous approaches, our method requires a small amount of effort for manual verbalization: only less than 15 minutes per event argument type is needed, and comparable results can be achieved with users with different level of expertise. △ Less",

In contrast, our model is less effective in a standard VQA task (VQA 2.0) confirming that our text-only method is specially effective for tasks requiring external knowledge. In addition, we show that increasing the language model's size improves notably its performance, yielding results comparable to the state-of-the-art with our largest model, significantly outperforming current multimodal systems, even though augmented with external knowledge.

      "abstract": "Generating an image from its textual description requires both a certain level of language understanding and common sense knowledge about the spatial relations of the physical entities being described. In this work, we focus on inferring the spatial relation between entities, a key step in the process of composing scenes based on text. More specifically, given a caption containing a mention to a subject and the location and size of the bounding box of that subject, our goal is to predict the location and size of an object mentioned in the caption. Previous work did not use the caption text information, but a manually provided relation holding between the subject and the object. In fact, the used evaluation datasets contain manually annotated ontological triplets but no captions, making the exercise unrealistic: a manual step was required; and systems did not leverage the richer information in captions. Here we present a system that uses the full caption, and Relations in Captions (REC-COCO), a dataset derived from MS-COCO which allows to evaluate spatial relation inference from captions directly. Our experiments show that: (1) it is possible to infer the size and location of an object with respect to a given subject directly from the caption; (2) the use of full text allows to place the object better than using a manually annotated relation. Our work paves the way for systems that, given a caption, decide which entities need to be depicted and their respective location and sizes, in order to then generate the final image. △ Less",

      "title": "Beyond Offline Mapping: Learning Cross Lingual Word Embeddings through Context Anchoring",
      "abstract": "Recent research on cross-lingual word embeddings has been dominated by unsupervised mapping approaches that align monolingual embeddings. Such methods critically rely on those embeddings having a similar structure, but it was recently shown that the separate training in different languages causes departures from this assumption. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach that does not have this limitation, while requiring a weak seed dictionary (e.g., a list of identical words) as the only form of supervision. Rather than aligning two fixed embedding spaces, our method works by fixing the target language embeddings, and learning a new set of embeddings for the source language that are aligned with them. To that end, we use an extension of skip-gram that leverages translated context words as anchor points, and incorporates self-learning and iterative restarts to reduce the dependency on the initial dictionary. Our approach outperforms conventional mapping methods on bilingual lexicon induction, and obtains competitive results in the downstream XNLI task. △ Less",

We perform simulated experiments on document classification (for development) and Conversational Question Answering datasets like QuAC and DoQA, where binary user feedback is derived from gold annotations. The results show that our method is able to improve over the initial supervised system, getting close to a fully-supervised system that has access to the same labeled examples in in-domain experiments (QuAC), and even matching in out-of-domain experiments (DoQA).

Evaluations requiring humans to converse with chatbots are time and cost-intensive, put high cognitive demands on the human judges, and yield low-quality results. In this work, we introduce \\emph{Spot The Bot}, a cost-efficient and robust evaluation framework that replaces human-bot conversations with conversations between bots. Human judges then only annotate for each entity in a conversation whether they think it is human or not (assuming there are humans participants in these conversations). These annotations then allow us to rank chatbots regarding their ability to mimic the conversational behavior of humans. Since we expect that all bots are eventually recognized as such, we incorporate a metric that measures which chatbot can uphold human-like behavior the longest, i.e., \\emph{Survival Analysis}. This metric has the ability to correlate a bot's performance to certain of its characteristics (e.g., \\ fluency or sensibleness), yielding interpretable results. The comparably low cost of our framework allows for frequent evaluations of chatbots during their evaluation cycle. We empirically validate our claims by applying \\emph{Spot The Bot} to three domains, evaluating several state-of-the-art chatbots, and drawing comparisons to related work.

In addition, we introduce a more realistic information retrieval(IR) scenario where the system needs to find the answer in any of the FAQ documents. The results of an existing, strong, system show that, thanks to transfer learning from a Wikipedia QA dataset and fine tuning on a single FAQ domain, it is possible to build high quality conversational QA systems for FAQs without in-domain training data.

For this, we introduce an intermediate representation that is based on the logical query plan in a database called Operation Trees (OT). This representation allows us to invert the annotation process without losing flexibility in the types of queries that we generate. Furthermore, it allows for fine-grained alignment of query tokens to OT operations. In our method, we randomly generate OTs from a context-free grammar. Afterwards, annotators have to write the appropriate natural language question that is represented by the OT. Finally, the annotators assign the tokens to the OT operations. We apply the method to create a new corpus OTTA (Operation Trees and Token Assignment), a large semantic parsing corpus for evaluating natural language interfaces to databases. We compare OTTA to Spider and LC-QuaD 2.0 and show that our methodology more than triples the annotation speed while maintaining the complexity of the queries. Finally, we train a state-of-the-art semantic parsing model on our data and show that our corpus is a challenging dataset and that the token alignment can be leveraged to increase the performance significantly. △ Less",

In this paper, we show that such translation process can introduce subtle artifacts that have a notable impact in existing cross-lingual models. For instance, in natural language inference, translating the premise and the hypothesis independently can reduce the lexical overlap between them, which current models are highly sensitive to. We show that some previous findings in cross-lingual transfer learning need to be reconsidered in the light of this phenomenon. Based on the gained insights, we also improve the state-of-the-art in XNLI for the translate-test and zero-shot approaches by 4.3 and 2.8 points, respectively. △ Less",

      "abstract": "The combination of visual and textual representations has produced excellent results in tasks such as image captioning and visual question answering, but the inference capabilities of multimodal representations are largely untested. In the case of textual representations, inference tasks such as Textual Entailment and Semantic Textual Similarity have been often used to benchmark the quality of textual representations. The long term goal of our research is to devise multimodal representation techniques that improve current inference capabilities. We thus present a novel task, Visual Semantic Textual Similarity (vSTS), where such inference ability can be tested directly. Given two items comprised each by an image and its accompanying caption, vSTS systems need to assess the degree to which the captions in context are semantically equivalent to each other. Our experiments using simple multimodal representations show that the addition of image representations produces better inference, compared to text-only representations. The improvement is observed both when directly computing the similarity between the representations of the two items, and when learning a siamese network based on vSTS training data. Our work shows, for the first time, the successful contribution of visual information to textual inference, with ample room for benchmarking more complex multimodal representation options. △ Less",

      "abstract": "Word embeddings and pre-trained language models allow to build rich representations of text and have enabled improvements across most NLP tasks. Unfortunately they are very expensive to train, and many small companies and research groups tend to use models that have been pre-trained and made available by third parties, rather than building their own. This is suboptimal as, for many languages, the models have been trained on smaller (or lower quality) corpora. In addition, monolingual pre-trained models for non-English languages are not always available. At best, models for those languages are included in multilingual versions, where each language shares the quota of substrings and parameters with the rest of the languages. This is particularly true for smaller languages such as Basque. In this paper we show that a number of monolingual models (FastText word embeddings, FLAIR and BERT language models) trained with larger Basque corpora produce much better results than publicly available versions in downstream NLP tasks, including topic classification, sentiment classification, PoS tagging and NER. This work sets a new state-of-the-art in those tasks for Basque. All benchmarks and models used in this work are publicly available. △ Less",

Its iterative variant, where two opposite NMT models are jointly trained by alternately using a synthetic parallel corpus generated by the reverse model, plays a central role in unsupervised machine translation. In order to start producing sound translations and provide a meaningful training signal to each other, existing approaches rely on either a separate machine translation system to warm up the iterative procedure, or some form of pre-training to initialize the weights of the model. In this paper, we analyze the role that such initialization plays in iterative back-translation. Is the behavior of the final system heavily dependent on it? Or does iterative back-translation converge to a similar solution given any reasonable initialization? Through a series of empirical experiments over a diverse set of warmup systems, we show that, although the quality of the initial system does affect final performance, its effect is relatively small, as iterative back-translation has a strong tendency to convergence to a similar solution. As such, the margin of improvement left for the initialization method is narrow, suggesting that future research should focus more on improving the iterative mechanism itself. △ Less",

This way, instead of directly inducing a bilingual lexicon from cross-lingual embeddings, we use them to build a phrase-table, combine it with a language model, and use the resulting machine translation system to generate a synthetic parallel corpus, from which we extract the bilingual lexicon using statistical word alignment techniques. As such, our method can work with any word embedding and cross-lingual mapping technique, and it does not require any additional resource besides the monolingual corpus used to train the embeddings. When evaluated on the exact same cross-lingual embeddings, our proposed method obtains an average improvement of 6 accuracy points over nearest neighbor and 4 points over CSLS retrieval, establishing a new state-of-the-art in the standard MUSE dataset. △ Less",

While several authors have questioned the underlying isomorphism assumption, which states that word embeddings in different languages have approximately the same structure, it is not clear whether this is an inherent limitation of mapping approaches or a more general issue when learning cross-lingual embeddings. So as to answer this question, we experiment with parallel corpora, which allows us to compare offline mapping to an extension of skip-gram that jointly learns both embedding spaces. We observe that, under these ideal conditions, joint learning yields to more isomorphic embeddings, is less sensitive to hubness, and obtains stronger results in bilingual lexicon induction. We thus conclude that current mapping methods do have strong limitations, calling for further research to jointly learn cross-lingual embeddings with a weaker cross-lingual signal. △ Less",

Our main findings are: (i) Information about a sense is generally represented well in a single-vector embedding - if the sense is frequent. (ii) A classifier can accurately predict whether a word is single-sense or multi-sense, based only on its embedding.
