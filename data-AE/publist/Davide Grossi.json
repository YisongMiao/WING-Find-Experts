      "title": "Diverse Committees with Incomplete or Inaccurate Approval Ballots",
      "abstract": "We study diversity in approval-based committee elections with incomplete or inaccurate information. We define diversity according to the Maximum Coverage problem, which is known to be \\textsc{np}-complete, with a best attainable polynomial time approximation ratio of $1-1/\\e$. In the incomplete information setting, voters vote only on a small portion of the candidates, and we prove that getting arbitrarily close to the optimal approximation ratio w.h.p. requires $Ω(m^2)$ non-adaptive queries, where $m$ is the number of candidates. This motivates studying adaptive querying algorithms, that can adapt their querying strategy to information obtained from previous query outcomes. In that setting, we lower this bound to only $Ω(m)$ queries. We propose a greedy algorithm to match this lower bound up to log-factors. We prove the same $\\tildeΘ(m)$ bound for the generalized problem of Max Cover over a matroid constraint, using a local search algorithm. Specifying a matroid of valid committees lets us implement extra structural requirements on the committee, like quota. In the inaccurate information setting, voters' responses are corrupted with a small probability. We prove $\\tildeΘ(nm)$ queries are required to attain a $(1-1/\\e)$-approximation with high probability, where $n$ is the number of voters. While the proven bounds show that all our algorithms are viable asymptotically, they also show that some of them would still require large numbers of queries in instances of practical relevance. Using real data from Polis as well as synthetic data, we observe that our algorithms perform well also on smaller instances, both with incomplete and inaccurate information. △ Less",

      "title": "Delegations as Adaptive Representation Patterns: Rethinking Influence in Liquid Democracy",
      "abstract": "Liquid democracy is a mechanism for the division of labor in decision-making through the transitive delegation of influence. In essence, all individuals possess the autonomy to determine the issues with which they will engage directly, while for other matters, they may appoint a representative of their choosing. So far, the literature has studied the delegation structures emerging in liquid democracy as static. As a result, transitivity defined as the capacity to transfer acquired authority to another entity, has been identified as a concern as it would be conducive to unrestrained accumulation of power. Focusing on the implementation of liquid democracy supported by the LiquidFeedback software, we propose a novel approach to assessing the influence of voting nodes in a transitive delegation graph, taking into account the process nature of real-world liquid democracy in which delegation and voting are distinct and increasingly independent activities. By introducing a novel model of delegations in liquid democracy, we show how transitivity may in fact contribute to an effective regulation of deliberation influence and decision-making power. While maintaining the one-person, one-vote paradigm for all votes cast, the anticipated influence of an agent, to the extent it is stemming from transitivity, experiences a precipitous decline following an exponential trajectory. In general, it is our objective to move the first steps towards a rigorous analysis of liquid democracy as an adaptive democratic representation process. The adaptivity aspect of liquid democracy has not yet been explored within the existing academic literature despite it being, we believe, one of its most important features. We therefore also outline a research agenda focusing on this aspect of liquid democracy. △ Less",

      "title": "Quantum Information meets High-Energy Physics: Input to the update of the European Strategy for Particle Physics",
      "abstract": "Some of the most astonishing and prominent properties of Quantum Mechanics, such as entanglement and Bell nonlocality, have only been studied extensively in dedicated low-energy laboratory setups. The feasibility of these studies in the high-energy regime explored by particle colliders was only recently shown, and has gathered the attention of the scientific community. For the range of particles and fundamental interactions involved, particle colliders provide a novel environment where quantum information theory can be probed, with energies exceeding by about 12 orders of magnitude those employed in dedicated laboratory setups. Furthermore, collider detectors have inherent advantages in performing certain quantum information measurements, and allow for the reconstruction of the state of the system under consideration via quantum state tomography. Here, we elaborate on the potential, challenges, and goals of this innovative and rapidly evolving line of research, and discuss its expected impact on both quantum information theory and high-energy physics. △ Less",

      "title": "Centrally Coordinated Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Power Grid Topology Control",
      "abstract": "Power grid operation is becoming more complex due to the increase in generation of renewable energy. The recent series of Learning To Run a Power Network (L2RPN) competitions have encouraged the use of artificial agents to assist human dispatchers in operating power grids. However, the combinatorial nature of the action space poses a challenge to both conventional optimizers and learned controllers. Action space factorization, which breaks down decision-making into smaller sub-tasks, is one approach to tackle the curse of dimensionality. In this study, we propose a centrally coordinated multi-agent (CCMA) architecture for action space factorization. In this approach, regional agents propose actions and subsequently a coordinating agent selects the final action. We investigate several implementations of the CCMA architecture, and benchmark in different experimental settings against various L2RPN baseline approaches. The CCMA architecture exhibits higher sample efficiency and superior final performance than the baseline approaches. The results suggest high potential of the CCMA approach for further application in higher-dimensional L2RPN as well as real-world power grid settings. △ Less",

      "abstract": "Addressing the question of how to achieve optimal decision-making under risk and uncertainty is crucial for enhancing the capabilities of artificial agents that collaborate with or support humans. In this work, we address this question in the context of Public Goods Games. We study learning in a novel multi-objective version of the Public Goods Game where agents have different risk preferences, by means of multi-objective reinforcement learning. We introduce a parametric non-linear utility function to model risk preferences at the level of individual agents, over the collective and individual reward components of the game. We study the interplay between such preference modelling and environmental uncertainty on the incentive alignment level in the game. We demonstrate how different combinations of individual preferences and environmental uncertainties sustain the emergence of cooperative patterns in non-cooperative environments (i.e., where competitive strategies are dominant), while others sustain competitive patterns in cooperative environments (i.e., where cooperative strategies are dominant). △ Less",

      "abstract": "Limited Voting (LV) is an approval-based method for multi-winner elections where all ballots are required to have a same fixed size. While it appears to be used as voting method in corporate governance and has some political applications, to the best of our knowledge, no formal analysis of the rule exists to date. We provide such an analysis here, prompted by a request for advice about this voting rule by a health insurance company in the Netherlands, which uses it to elect its work council. We study conditions under which LV would improve representation over standard approval voting and when it would not. We establish the extent of such an improvement, or lack thereof, both in terms of diversity and proportionality notions. These results help us understand if, and how, LV may be used as a low-effort fix of approval voting in order to enhance representation. △ Less",

      "title": "Enumerating Graphlets with Amortized Time Complexity Independent of Graph Size",
      "abstract": "Graphlets of order $k$ in a graph $G$ are connected subgraphs induced by $k$ nodes (called $k$-graphlets) or by $k$ edges (called edge $k$-graphlets). They are among the interesting subgraphs in network analysis to get insights on both the local and global structure of a network. While several algorithms exist for discovering and enumerating graphlets, the cost per solution of such algorithms typically depends on the size of the graph $G$, or its maximum degree. In real networks, even the latter can be in the order of millions, whereas $k$ is typically required to be a small value. In this paper we provide the first algorithm to list all graphlets of order $k$ in a graph $G=(V,E)$ with an amortized cost per solution depending \\emph{solely} on the order $k$, contrarily to previous approaches where the cost depends \\emph{also} on the size of $G$ or its maximum degree. Specifically, we show that it is possible to list $k$-graphlets in $O(k^2)$ time per solution, and to list edge $k$-graphlets in $O(k)$ time per solution. Furthermore we show that, if the input graph has bounded degree, then the cost per solution for listing $k$-graphlets is reduced to $O(k)$. Whenever $k = O(1)$, as it is often the case in practical settings, these algorithms are the first to achieve constant time per solution. △ Less",

      "title": "Emergent Cooperation under Uncertain Incentive Alignment",
      "abstract": "Understanding the emergence of cooperation in systems of computational agents is crucial for the development of effective cooperative AI. Interaction among individuals in real-world settings are often sparse and occur within a broad spectrum of incentives, which often are only partially known. In this work, we explore how cooperation can arise among reinforcement learning agents in scenarios characterised by infrequent encounters, and where agents face uncertainty about the alignment of their incentives with those of others. To do so, we train the agents under a wide spectrum of environments ranging from fully competitive, to fully cooperative, to mixed-motives. Under this type of uncertainty we study the effects of mechanisms, such as reputation and intrinsic rewards, that have been proposed in the literature to foster cooperation in mixed-motives environments. Our findings show that uncertainty substantially lowers the agents' ability to engage in cooperative behaviour, when that would be the best course of action. In this scenario, the use of effective reputation mechanisms and intrinsic rewards boosts the agents' capability to act nearly-optimally in cooperative environments, while greatly enhancing cooperation in mixed-motive environments as well. △ Less",

Within the classical Condorcet error model for collective binary decisions, we establish equivalence results between elections and markets, showing that the alternative that would be selected by weighted majority voting (under specific weighting schemes) corresponds to the alternative with highest price in the equilibrium of the market (under specific assumptions on the market type). This makes it possible in principle to implement specific weighted majority elections, which are known to have superior truth-tracking performance, by means of information markets without needing to elicit voters' competences. △ Less",

      "abstract": "The popularity of an opinion in one's direct circles is not necessarily a good indicator of its popularity in one's entire community. Network structures make local information about global properties of the group potentially inaccurate, and the way a social network is wired constrains what kind of information distortion can actually occur. In this paper, we discuss which classes of networks allow for a large enough proportion of the population to get a wrong enough impression about the overall distribution of opinions. We start by focusing on the 'majority illusion', the case where one sees a majority opinion in one's direct circles that differs from the global majority. We show that no network structure can guarantee that most agents see the correct majority. We then perform computational experiments to study the likelihood of majority illusions in different classes of networks. Finally, we generalize to other types of illusions. △ Less",

      "title": "Quantum Advantage Seeker with Kernels (QuASK): a software framework to speed up the research in quantum machine learning",
      "abstract": "Exploiting the properties of quantum information to the benefit of machine learning models is perhaps the most active field of research in quantum computation. This interest has supported the development of a multitude of software frameworks (e.g. Qiskit, Pennylane, Braket) to implement, simulate, and execute quantum algorithms. Most of them allow us to define quantum circuits, run basic quantum algorithms, and access low-level primitives depending on the hardware such software is supposed to run. For most experiments, these frameworks have to be manually integrated within a larger machine learning software pipeline. The researcher is in charge of knowing different software packages, integrating them through the development of long code scripts, analyzing the results, and generating the plots. Long code often leads to erroneous applications, due to the average number of bugs growing proportional with respect to the program length. Moreover, other researchers will struggle to understand and reproduce the experiment, due to the need to be familiar with all the different software frameworks involved in the code script. We propose QuASK, an open-source quantum machine learning framework written in Python that aids the researcher in performing their experiments, with particular attention to quantum kernel techniques. QuASK can be used as a command-line tool to download datasets, pre-process them, quantum machine learning routines, analyze and visualize the results. QuASK implements most state-of-the-art algorithms to analyze the data through quantum kernels, with the possibility to use projected kernels, (gradient-descent) trainable quantum kernels, and structure-optimized quantum kernels. Our framework can also be used as a library and integrated into pre-existing software, maximizing code reuse. △ Less",

We show that in this setting -- unlike in the standard one where votes are always delegated in full to one proxy -- it becomes possible to identify delegation structures that optimize the truth-tracking accuracy of the group. We contrast this centralized solution with the group accuracy obtained in equilibrium when agents interact by greedily trying to maximize their own individual accuracy through mixed delegations, and study the price of anarchy of these games. While equilibria with mixed delegations may be as bad as in the standard delegations setting, they are never worse and may sometimes be better. △ Less",

Forks usually come at a cost, and can be seen as consequences of collective decisions that destabilize the community. Here, we provide a social choice setting in which agents can report preferences not only over a set of alternatives, but also over the possible forks that may occur in the face of disagreement. We study this social choice setting, concentrating on stability issues and concerns of strategic agent behavior. △ Less",

A multi-group neutron flux measurement is obtained through an unfolding algorithm based on a Bayesian statistical model.

The theory is developed in three steps. First, the paper introduces a graded generalization of the two key notions underpinning Dung's semantics: self-defense and conflict-freeness. This leads to a natural generalization of Dung's semantics, whereby standard extensions are weakened or strengthened depending on the level of self-defense and conflict-freeness they meet. The paper investigates the fixpoint theory of these semantics, establishing existence results for them. Second, the paper shows how graded semantics readily provide an approach to argument rankings, offering a novel contribution to the recently growing research programme on ranking-based semantics. Third, this novel approach to argument ranking is applied and studied in the context of instantiated argumentation frameworks, and in so doing is shown to account for a simple form of accrual of arguments within the Dung paradigm.

This embedding also sheds light on the relation between delegation cycles in liquid democracy and the probability of collective abstentions, as well as the issue of individual rationality in a delegable proxy voting setting. We then show how liquid democracy on binary issues can be modeled and analyzed also as a specific process of dynamics of binary opinions on networks. These processes---called Boolean DeGroot processes---are a special case of the DeGroot stochastic model of opinion diffusion. We establish the convergence conditions of such processes and show they provide some novel insights on how the effects of delegation cycles and individual rationality could be mitigated within liquid democracy. The study is a first attempt to provide theoretical foundations to the delgable proxy features of the liquid democracy voting system. Our analysis suggests recommendations on how the system may be modified to make it more resilient with respect to the handling of delegation cycles and of inconsistent majorities. △ Less",

      "abstract": "Gossip protocols aim at arriving, by means of point-to-point or group communications, at a situation in which all the agents know each other's secrets. We consider distributed gossip protocols which are expressed by means of epistemic logic. We provide an operational semantics of such protocols and set up an appropriate framework to argue about their correctness. Then we analyze specific protocols for complete graphs and for directed rings. △ Less",

      "title": "Equilibrium Refinement through Negotiation in Binary Voting",
      "abstract": "We study voting games on binary issues, where voters hold an objective over the outcome of the collective decision and are allowed, before the vote takes place, to negotiate their voting strategy with the other participants. We analyse the voters' rational behaviour in the resulting two-phase game, showing under what conditions undesirable equilibria can be removed and desirable ones sustained as a consequence of the pre-vote phase. △ Less",

      "title": "Ceteris Paribus Structure in Logics of Game Forms",
      "abstract": "The article introduces a ceteris paribus modal logic interpreted on the equivalence classes induced by sets of propositional atoms. This logic is used to embed two logics of agency and games, namely atemporal STIT and the coalition logic of propositional control (CL-PC). The embeddings highlight a common ceteris paribus structure underpinning the key modal operators of both logics, they clarify the relationship between STIT and CL-PC, and enable the transfer of complexity results to the ceteris paribus logic. △ Less",
