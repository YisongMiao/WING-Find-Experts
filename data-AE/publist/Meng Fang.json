      "title": "LongCat-Flash Technical Report",
      "abstract": "We introduce LongCat-Flash, a 560-billion-parameter Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) language model designed for both computational efficiency and advanced agentic capabilities. Stemming from the need for scalable efficiency, LongCat-Flash adopts two novel designs: (a) Zero-computation Experts, which enables dynamic computational budget allocation and activates 18.6B-31.3B (27B on average) per token depending on contextual demands, optimizing resource usage. (b) Shortcut-connected MoE, which enlarges the computation-communication overlap window, demonstrating notable gains in inference efficiency and throughput compared to models of a comparable scale. We develop a comprehensive scaling framework for large models that combines hyperparameter transfer, model-growth initialization, a multi-pronged stability suite, and deterministic computation to achieve stable and reproducible training. Notably, leveraging the synergy among scalable architectural design and infrastructure efforts, we complete model training on more than 20 trillion tokens within 30 days, while achieving over 100 tokens per second (TPS) for inference at a cost of \\$0.70 per million output tokens. To cultivate LongCat-Flash towards agentic intelligence, we conduct a large-scale pre-training on optimized mixtures, followed by targeted mid- and post-training on reasoning, code, and instructions, with further augmentation from synthetic data and tool use tasks. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that, as a non-thinking foundation model, LongCat-Flash delivers highly competitive performance among other leading models, with exceptional strengths in agentic tasks. The model checkpoint of LongCat-Flash is open-sourced to foster community research.

      "title": "Chip-Scale Rydberg Atomic Electrometer",
      "abstract": "An ideal electrometer should measure electric fields accurately while causing minimal disturbance to the field itself. Rydberg atomic electrometers are promising candidates for ideal electrometry due to their SI traceability and non-invasive nature. However, in practice, the atomic vapor cell shell can distort the electric field, limiting the device's performance. In this work, we overcome this challenge by fabricating a chip-scale vapor cell using a novel combination of femtosecond laser writing and optical contact. This method enables the development of a non-invasive atomic electrometer with a radar cross-section (RCS) 20 dB lower than that of commercial atomic cell-based electrometers. Furthermore, we observe a new sub-Doppler spectral narrowing phenomenon in these chip-scale cells. The effect originates from an incoherent, collision-driven mechanism--hereafter referred to as incoherent Dicke narrowing (ICDN). This advancement supports future revisions to the international system of units and broadens applications in metrology and quantum measurement. △ Less",

      "title": "Asymmetric stress engineering of dense dislocations in brittle superconductors for strong vortex pinning",
      "abstract": "Large lossless currents in high-temperature superconductors (HTS) critically rely on dense defects with suitable size and dimensionality to pin vortices, with dislocations being particularly effective due to their one-dimensional geometry to interact extensively with vortex lines. However, in non-metallic compounds such as HTS with rigid lattices, conventional deformation methods typically lead to catastrophic fracture rather than dislocation-mediated plasticity, making it a persistent challenge to introduce dislocations at high density. Here, we propose an asymmetric stress field strategy using extrusion to directly nucleate a high-density of dislocations in HTS by activating shear-driven lattice slip and twisting under superimposed hydrostatic compression. As demonstrated in iron-based superconductors (IBS), atomic displacements of nearly one angstrom trigger the formation of tilted dislocation lines with a density approaching that of metals. With further structural refinement, these dislocations serve as strong pinning centers that lead to a fivefold enhancement in the current-carrying capacity of IBS at 33 T, along with low anisotropy and a large irreversibility field. This work not only establishes a scalable route to engineer pinning landscapes in HTS, but also offers a generalizable framework for manipulating dislocation structures in rigid crystalline systems. △ Less",

      "title": "Accelerating LLM Inference via Dynamic KV Cache Placement in Heterogeneous Memory System",
      "abstract": "Large Language Model (LLM) inference is increasingly constrained by memory bandwidth, with frequent access to the key-value (KV) cache dominating data movement. While attention sparsity reduces some memory traffic, the relevance of past tokens varies over time, requiring the full KV cache to remain accessible and sustaining pressure on both bandwidth and capacity. With advances in interconnects such as NVLink and LPDDR5X, modern AI hardware now integrates high-bandwidth memory (HBM) with high-speed off-package DRAM, making heterogeneous memory systems a practical solution. This work investigates dynamic KV cache placement across such systems to maximize aggregated bandwidth utilization under capacity constraints. Rather than proposing a specific scheduling policy, we formulate the placement problem mathematically and derive a theoretical upper bound, revealing substantial headroom for runtime optimization. To our knowledge, this is the first formal treatment of dynamic KV cache scheduling in heterogeneous memory systems for LLM inference. △ Less",

      "abstract": "The study of the charmed baryons is crucial for investigating the strong and weak interactions in the Standard Model and for gaining insights into the internal structure of baryons. In an $e^+e^-$ experiment the lightest charmed baryon, $Λ_c^+$, can be produced in pairs through the single photon annihilation process. This process can be described by two complex electromagnetic form factors. The presence of a non-zero relative phase between these form factors gives rise to a transverse polarization of the charmed baryon and provides additional constraints on the dynamic parameters in the decays. In this article, we present the first observation of the transverse polarization of $Λ_{c}^{+}$ in the reaction $e^+e^- \\to Λ_c^{+}\\barΛ_c^-$, based on $6.4~\\text{fb}^{-1}$ of $e^{+}e^{-}$ annihilation data collected at center-of-mass energies between 4600 MeV and 4951 MeV with the BESIII detector.

      "abstract": "Recent advances in large language models have sparked growing interest in AI agents capable of solving complex, real-world tasks. However, most existing agent systems rely on manually crafted configurations that remain static after deployment, limiting their ability to adapt to dynamic and evolving environments. To this end, recent research has explored agent evolution techniques that aim to automatically enhance agent systems based on interaction data and environmental feedback. This emerging direction lays the foundation for self-evolving AI agents, which bridge the static capabilities of foundation models with the continuous adaptability required by lifelong agentic systems. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of existing techniques for self-evolving agentic systems. Specifically, we first introduce a unified conceptual framework that abstracts the feedback loop underlying the design of self-evolving agentic systems. The framework highlights four key components: System Inputs, Agent System, Environment, and Optimisers, serving as a foundation for understanding and comparing different strategies. Based on this framework, we systematically review a wide range of self-evolving techniques that target different components of the agent system. We also investigate domain-specific evolution strategies developed for specialised fields such as biomedicine, programming, and finance, where optimisation objectives are tightly coupled with domain constraints. In addition, we provide a dedicated discussion on the evaluation, safety, and ethical considerations for self-evolving agentic systems, which are critical to ensuring their effectiveness and reliability. This survey aims to provide researchers and practitioners with a systematic understanding of self-evolving AI agents, laying the foundation for the development of more adaptive, autonomous, and lifelong agentic systems. △ Less",

      "abstract": "Self-Rewarding Language Models propose an architecture in which the Large Language Models(LLMs) both generates responses and evaluates its own outputs via LLM-as-a-Judge prompting, dynamically improving its generative capabilities through iterative Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). However, our analysis reveals a critical limitation in existing Self-Rewarding paradigms: the synchronized improvement of chosen and rejected responses progressively narrows the representational difference between contrasting samples, undermining effective preference learning. We propose \\textbf{Temporal Self-Rewarding Language Models} that strategically coordinate past, present, and future model generations to sustain learning signals. Our dual-phase framework introduces: (1) \\textit{Anchored Rejection} - fixing rejected responses using the past initial model's outputs and (2) \\textit{Future-Guided Chosen} - dynamically curating chosen samples using next-generation model predictions. Extensive experiments across three model families (Llama, Qwen, Mistral) and different model sizes (Llama3B/8B/70B) demonstrate significant improvements when trained with our method compared to Self-Rewarding using same computation resources. For example, Llama3.1-8B reaches a 29.44 win rate on AlpacaEval 2.0 with our method, outperforming the Self-Rewarding baseline (19.69) by 9.75.

However, existing evaluations focus mainly on surface-level perception, leaving the capacity of models for contextual and inference-driven reasoning in speech-based scenarios insufficiently examined. To address this gap, we introduce SpeechR, a unified benchmark for evaluating reasoning over speech in large audio-language models. SpeechR evaluates models along three key dimensions: factual retrieval, procedural inference, and normative judgment. It includes three distinct evaluation formats. The multiple-choice version measures answer selection accuracy. The generative version assesses the coherence and logical consistency of reasoning chains. The acoustic-feature version investigates whether variations in stress and emotion affect reasoning performance. Evaluations on eleven state-of-the-art LALMs reveal that high transcription accuracy does not translate into strong reasoning capabilities. SpeechR establishes a structured benchmark for evaluating reasoning in spoken language, enabling more targeted analysis of model capabilities across diverse dialogue-based tasks. △ Less",

      "abstract": "The emergence of AI agents powered by large language models (LLMs) marks a pivotal shift toward the Agentic Web, a new phase of the internet defined by autonomous, goal-driven interactions. In this paradigm, agents interact directly with one another to plan, coordinate, and execute complex tasks on behalf of users. This transition from human-driven to machine-to-machine interaction allows intent to be delegated, relieving users from routine digital operations and enabling a more interactive, automated web experience. In this paper, we present a structured framework for understanding and building the Agentic Web. We trace its evolution from the PC and Mobile Web eras and identify the core technological foundations that support this shift. Central to our framework is a conceptual model consisting of three key dimensions: intelligence, interaction, and economics. These dimensions collectively enable the capabilities of AI agents, such as retrieval, recommendation, planning, and collaboration. We analyze the architectural and infrastructural challenges involved in creating scalable agentic systems, including communication protocols, orchestration strategies, and emerging paradigms such as the Agent Attention Economy. We conclude by discussing the potential applications, societal risks, and governance issues posed by agentic systems, and outline research directions for developing open, secure, and intelligent ecosystems shaped by both human intent and autonomous agent behavior.

The resulting models support several additional languages while understanding images and executing tool calls. In public benchmarks and human evaluations, both the server model and the on-device model match or surpass comparably sized open baselines. A new Swift-centric Foundation Models framework exposes guided generation, constrained tool calling, and LoRA adapter fine-tuning, allowing developers to integrate these capabilities with a few lines of code.

      "abstract": "Text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis has seen renewed progress under the discrete modeling paradigm. Existing autoregressive approaches often rely on single-codebook representations, which suffer from significant information loss. Even with post-hoc refinement techniques such as flow matching, these methods fail to recover fine-grained details (e.g., prosodic nuances, speaker-specific timbres), especially in challenging scenarios like singing voice or music synthesis. We propose QTTS, a novel TTS framework built upon our new audio codec, QDAC. The core innovation of QDAC lies in its end-to-end training of an ASR-based auto-regressive network with a GAN, which achieves superior semantic feature disentanglement for scalable, near-lossless compression. QTTS models these discrete codes using two innovative strategies: the Hierarchical Parallel architecture, which uses a dual-AR structure to model inter-codebook dependencies for higher-quality synthesis, and the Delay Multihead approach, which employs parallelized prediction with a fixed delay to accelerate inference speed. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves higher synthesis quality and better preserves expressive content compared to baseline. This suggests that scaling up compression via multi-codebook modeling is a promising direction for high-fidelity, general-purpose speech and audio generation. △ Less",

This paradigm, exemplified by recent research works such as Search-R1, enables the model to decide when to search and obtain external information. However, the queries generated by such Agentic RAG models and the role of the retriever in obtaining high-quality answers remain understudied. To this end, this initial study examines the applicability of query performance prediction (QPP) within the recent Agentic RAG models Search-R1 and R1-Searcher. We find that applying effective retrievers can achieve higher answer quality within a shorter reasoning process. Moreover, the QPP estimates of the generated queries, used as an approximation of their retrieval quality, are positively correlated with the quality of the final answer.

      "abstract": "Training data for class-conditional image synthesis often exhibit a long-tailed distribution with limited images for tail classes. Such an imbalance causes mode collapse and reduces the diversity of synthesized images for tail classes. For class-conditional diffusion models trained on imbalanced data, we aim to improve the diversity of tail class images without compromising the fidelity and diversity of head class images. We achieve this by introducing two deceptively simple but highly effective contrastive loss functions. Firstly, we employ an unsupervised InfoNCE loss utilizing negative samples to increase the distance/dissimilarity among synthetic images, particularly for tail classes. To further enhance the diversity of tail classes, our second loss is an MSE loss that contrasts class-conditional generation with unconditional generation at large timesteps. This second loss makes the denoising process insensitive to class conditions for the initial steps, which enriches tail classes through knowledge sharing from head classes. Conditional-unconditional alignment has been shown to enhance the performance of long-tailed GAN. We are the first to adapt such alignment to diffusion models. We successfully leveraged contrastive learning for class-imbalanced diffusion models. Our contrastive learning framework is easy to implement and outperforms standard DDPM and alternative methods for class-imbalanced diffusion models across various datasets, including CIFAR10/100-LT, PlacesLT, TinyImageNetLT, and ImageNetLT. △ Less",

While existing approaches are limited to generating static slides or text summaries, our method advances beyond these limitations by producing fully synchronized visual and spoken content that closely mimics human-style presentations. To achieve this integration, PresentAgent employs a modular pipeline that systematically segments the input document, plans and renders slide-style visual frames, generates contextual spoken narration with large language models and Text-to-Speech models, and seamlessly composes the final video with precise audio-visual alignment. Given the complexity of evaluating such multimodal outputs, we introduce PresentEval, a unified assessment framework powered by Vision-Language Models that comprehensively scores videos across three critical dimensions: content fidelity, visual clarity, and audience comprehension through prompt-based evaluation. Our experimental validation on a curated dataset of 30 document-presentation pairs demonstrates that PresentAgent approaches human-level quality across all evaluation metrics. These results highlight the significant potential of controllable multimodal agents in transforming static textual materials into dynamic, effective, and accessible presentation formats.

      "title": "EvoAgentX: An Automated Framework for Evolving Agentic Workflows",
      "abstract": "Multi-agent systems (MAS) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for orchestrating large language models (LLMs) and specialized tools to collaboratively address complex tasks. However, existing MAS frameworks often require manual workflow configuration and lack native support for dynamic evolution and performance optimization. In addition, many MAS optimization algorithms are not integrated into a unified framework. In this paper, we present EvoAgentX, an open-source platform that automates the generation, execution, and evolutionary optimization of multi-agent workflows. EvoAgentX employs a modular architecture consisting of five core layers: the basic components, agent, workflow, evolving, and evaluation layers. Specifically, within the evolving layer, EvoAgentX integrates three MAS optimization algorithms, TextGrad, AFlow, and MIPRO, to iteratively refine agent prompts, tool configurations, and workflow topologies. We evaluate EvoAgentX on HotPotQA, MBPP, and MATH for multi-hop reasoning, code generation, and mathematical problem solving, respectively, and further assess it on real-world tasks using GAIA. Experimental results show that EvoAgentX consistently achieves significant performance improvements, including a 7.44% increase in HotPotQA F1, a 10.00% improvement in MBPP pass@1, a 10.00% gain in MATH solve accuracy, and an overall accuracy improvement of up to 20.00% on GAIA.

      "title": "Observation of orbitally excited $B_{c}^{+}$ states",
      "abstract": "The observation of a wide peaking structure in the $B_{c}^{+} γ$ mass spectrum is reported using proton-proton collision data collected by the LHCb detector at center-of-mass energies of $7$, $8$ and $13~\\text{TeV}$, corresponding to a total integrated luminosity of $9~\\text{fb}^{-1}$. The statistical significance over the background-only hypothesis exceeds seven standard deviations. The width of the observed structure is larger than the expectation from a single-peak hypothesis, and is well described by an effective minimal model consisting of two narrow peaks located at $6704.8 \\pm 5.5 \\pm 2.8 \\pm 0.3~\\mathrm{Me\\kern -0.1em V\\!/}c^2$ and $6752.4 \\pm 9.5 \\pm 3.1 \\pm 0.3~\\mathrm{Me\\kern -0.1em V\\!/}c^2$. The uncertainty terms are statistical, systematic, and associated to the knowledge of the $B_{c}^{+}$ mass, respectively. The measured peak locations are in line with theoretical predictions for lowest excited $P$-wave $B_{c}^{+}$ states, marking the first observation of orbitally excited beauty-charm mesons and providing important insights into the internal dynamics of hadrons containing two heavy quarks. △ Less",

      "title": "Study of $B_{c}(1P)^{+}$ states in the $B_{c}^{+} γ$ mass spectrum",
      "abstract": "The study of a wide peaking structure in the $B_{c}^{+} γ$ mass spectrum is reported using a data sample of proton-proton collisions collected by the LHCb detector at center-of-mass energies of $7$, $8$ and $13~\\text{TeV}$, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of $9~\\text{fb}^{-1}$. The observed structure is consistent with the lowest excited $P$-wave $B_{c}^{+}$ states and exhibits a statistical significance exceeding seven standard deviations relative to the background-only hypothesis. A two-peak model serves as an effective description of the data, with various theory-constrained models further explored to provide physical interpretation. Based on the predictions for the $B_{c}(1P)^{+}$ spectrum, the relative production cross-section of the overall $B_{c}(1P)^{+}$ states with respect to the $B_{c}^{+}$ ground state with the transverse momentum $p_{\\text{T}}$ and rapidity $y$ of $B_{c}^{+}$ mesons in the regions $p_{\\text{T}}<20~\\mathrm{Ge\\kern -0.1em V\\!/}c$ and $2.0<y<4.5$ at $\\sqrt{s}=13~\\text{TeV}$ is measured to be $0.20 \\pm 0.03 \\pm 0.02 \\pm 0.03$, where the uncertainty terms represent statistical, systematic, and uncertainties related to the choice of theoretical models, respectively. The results provide a test of theoretical models and deepen our understanding of quantum chromodynamics. △ Less",

      "title": "MuRating: A High Quality Data Selecting Approach to Multilingual Large Language Model Pretraining",
      "abstract": "Data quality is a critical driver of large language model performance, yet existing model-based selection methods focus almost exclusively on English. We introduce MuRating, a scalable framework that transfers high-quality English data-quality signals into a single rater for 17 target languages. MuRating aggregates multiple English \"raters\" via pairwise comparisons to learn unified document-quality scores,then projects these judgments through translation to train a multilingual evaluator on monolingual, cross-lingual, and parallel text pairs. Applied to web data, MuRating selects balanced subsets of English and multilingual content to pretrain a 1.2 B-parameter LLaMA model. Compared to strong baselines, including QuRater, AskLLM, DCLM and so on, our approach boosts average accuracy on both English benchmarks and multilingual evaluations, with especially large gains on knowledge-intensive tasks. We further analyze translation fidelity, selection biases, and underrepresentation of narrative material, outlining directions for future work. △ Less",

      "abstract": "A time-integrated angular analysis of the decay $B^0_s \\rightarrow J/ψ\\overline{K}{}^{*}\\kern-1pt(892)^{0}$, with $J/ψ\\rightarrow μ^{+} μ^{-}$ and $\\overline{K}{}^{*}\\kern-1pt(892)^{0} \\rightarrow K^{-} π^{+}$, is presented. The analysis employs a sample of proton-proton collision data collected by the LHCb experiment during 2015-2018 at a centre-of-mass energy of $13 \\text{TeV}$, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of $6 \\text{fb}^{-1}$. A simultaneous maximum-likelihood fit is performed to the angular distributions in bins of the $K^{-} π^{+}$ mass. This fit yields measurements of the $CP$-averaged polarisation fractions and $CP$ asymmetries for the P-wave component of the $K^{-} π^{+}$ system. The longitudinal and parallel polarisation fractions are determined to be $f_{0} = 0.534 \\pm 0.012 \\pm 0.009$ and $f_{\\parallel} = 0.211 \\pm 0.014 \\pm 0.005$, respectively, where the first uncertainty is statistical and the second is systematic. The $CP$ asymmetries are measured with $3$-$7\\%$ precision and are found to be consistent with zero. These measurements, along with an updated determination of the branching fraction relative to the $B^0 \\rightarrow J/ψK^{*0}$ decay, are combined with previous LHCb results, providing the most precise values for these observables to date. △ Less",
